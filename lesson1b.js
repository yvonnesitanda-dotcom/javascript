// In Javascript,  you need to have an initializer for declaring a variable. In ES6 we have to main types of initialisers i.e:

// let : It declares values which can be changed later on.


let weight= 10.5

console.log(weight)

// const : It is used to declare variables which contains values that are not intended to be changed the entire programme

const pi= 3.142
console.log("The pi is:",pi)
