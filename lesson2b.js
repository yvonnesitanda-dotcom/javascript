// Comparison operators
// They usually evaluates to a boolean answer

let number1 = 5
let number2= 10
let number3= 20

console.log(number1==number2)
console.log(number1>=number2)
console.log(number1<=number2)
console.log(number1>number2)
console.log(number1<number2)
console.log(number2!=number2)


// Triple equal sign- Research in Javascript
// Logical operators are used to evaluate two or more conditions and they also give a boolean answer
// Logical AND(&&)- it evaluates to true if and only if all of the conditions/statements are true
console.log((number1 < number2) && (number2> number1))&& (number3>number2)

//logical OR(||) It evaluates to treus if one of the conditions is true.
console.log((number1 > number2)) ||
(number2> number1)

//Logical MOT (!) It is used to negate a condition/statement
console.log(number1<number2)
